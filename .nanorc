## Characters that are special in a shell should not be escaped here.
## Inside string parameters, quotes should not be escaped -- the last

# set cutfromcursor

## Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving it entirely blank.
# set emptyline

## Set the target width for automatic hard-wrapping and for justifying
## paragraphs. If the specified value is 0 or less, the wrapping point

## no plans to implement vim-style undo state in these files.
# set locking

## Fall back to slow libmagic to try and determine an applicable syntax.

set matchbrackets "(<[{)>]}"

## Suppress the title bar and show the filename plus a cursor-position
## percentage in the space of the status bar.
set minibar

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system. When enabled,

## double click), and execute shortcuts. The mouse will work in the
## X Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
set mouse

## Switch on multiple file buffers (inserting a file will put it into
## a separate buffer).
# set multibuffer

## Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format.
# set noconvert

## Don't display the helpful shortcut lists at the bottom of the screen.
set nohelp

## Don't automatically add a newline when a file does not end with one.
#set nonewlines

## Set operating directory. nano will not read or write files outside
## this directory and its subdirectories. Also, the current directory
## is changed to here, so any files are inserted from this dir. A blank
## string means the operating-directory feature is turned off.
# set operatingdir ""

## Remember the cursor position in each file for the next editing session.
set positionlog

## Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).

# set punct "!.?"

## Make status-bar messages disappear after 1 keystroke instead of after 20.
# set quickblank

# set saveonexit

## (The old form of this option, 'set tempfile', is deprecated.)

## Put the cursor on the highlighted item in the file browser, and
## show the cursor in the help viewer; useful for people who use a
## braille display and people with poor vision.
# set showcursor

## Make the Home key smarter: when Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards). If the
## cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true start
## of the line (the left edge).
set smarthome

## Spread overlong lines over multiple screen lines.
set softwrap

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one. This option
## does not have a default value.

## Use the end of the title bar for some state flags: I = auto-indenting,
## M = mark, L = hard-wrapping long lines, R = recording, S = soft-wrapping.
set stateflags

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0.
set tabsize 4

## Convert each typed tab to the fitting number of spaces.
set tabstospaces

## Snip whitespace at the end of lines when justifying or hard-wrapping.
# set trimblanks

## Save files by default in Unix format (also when they were DOS or Mac).
set unix

## The two single-column characters used to display the first characters
## of tabs and spaces. 187 in ISO 8859-1 (0000BB in Unicode) and 183 in
## ISO-8859-1 (0000B7 in Unicode) seem to be good values for these.
## The default when in a UTF-8 locale:
set whitespace "❘⎵"
## The default otherwise:
# set whitespace ">."

## Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation
## characters as parts of words.
# set wordbounds

## The characters (besides alphanumeric ones) that should be considered
## as parts of words. This option does not have a default value. When
## set, it overrides option 'set wordbounds'.
set wordchars "_"

## Let an unmodified Backspace or Delete erase the marked region (instead
## of a single character, and without affecting the cutbuffer).
set zap

## Hide the bars plus help lines and use the whole terminal as edit area.
#set zero

## Paint the interface elements of nano. These are examples; there are
## no colors by default, except for errorcolor and spotlightcolor.

set errorcolor bold,italic,red,normal

set promptcolor bold,italic,yellow,normal
set selectedcolor black,cyan
set spotlightcolor black,yellow

## === Key bindings ===

## For all details, see 'man nanorc', section REBINDING KEYS.

## If you want to suspend nano with one keystroke (instead of with ^T^Z):
# bind ^Z suspend main

## The <Ctrl+Delete> keystroke deletes the word to the right of the cursor.
## On some terminals the <Ctrl+Backspace> keystroke produces ^H, which is
## the ASCII character for backspace, so it is bound by default to the
## backspace function. The <Backspace> key itself produces a different
## keycode, which is hard-bound to the backspace function. So, if you
## normally use <Backspace> for backspacing and not ^H, you can make
## <Ctrl+Backspace> delete the word to the left of the cursor with:
bind ^H chopwordleft main

## For a more mnemonic Comment keystroke (overriding Cut-from-cursor):
# bind M-K comment main

## If you want ^L to just refresh the screen and not center the cursor:
# bind ^L refresh main

## When you sometimes type M-J instead of M-K, or M-T instead of M-R:
# unbind M-J main
# unbind M-T main
## (Those functions are still accessible through ^T^J and ^T^V.)

## For quickly uppercasing or lowercasing the word under the cursor.
## (These effectively do a Ctrl+Right followed by a Shift+Ctrl+Left,
## and then pipe the selected text through a sed command.)
unbind M-L main

bind Sh-M-U "{nextword}{mark}{prevword}{execute}|sed 's/.*/\U&/'{enter}" main
bind M-U "{nextword}{mark}{prevword}{execute}|sed 's/.*/\U&/'{enter}" main

bind Sh-M-L "{nextword}{mark}{prevword}{execute}|sed 's/.*/\L&/'{enter}" main
bind M-L "{nextword}{mark}{prevword}{execute}|sed 's/.*/\L&/'{enter}" main

## If you would like nano to have keybindings that are more "usual",
## such as ^O for Open, ^F for Find, ^H for Help, and ^Q for Quit,
## then uncomment |sed 's/.*/\L&/'

## Unbind weird behaviour
unbind M-K main # cut
unbind M-J main # justify paragraph or regionc
